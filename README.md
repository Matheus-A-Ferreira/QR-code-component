## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned how to apply the height of the body to the hole screen and how to aply "display: flex;" properly

```css
html{
  height: 100%;
}

body{
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100vw;      
  min-height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I noticed a need to practice more with CSS and learn how to use it properly

### Useful resources

- [CSS Layout - Horizontal & Vertical Align](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand many methods I can use to centralize an element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
